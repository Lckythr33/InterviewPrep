Reach out with your avaliability so there is less back and forth 

Congrats on your work at Ring keeping people and homes safe! It really is a great service that myself and my family use to keep us, our home, and our neighborhood safe. I'd love to learn from your experience interviewing software engineers for this company. Would you be opposed to setting up a call with me to touch base on that? I am available between 3-6pm PST.

Hi Yuqi,

I am amazed at your success of moving from HealthStream to eventually Intuit.  All I can say is wow and kudos to your accomplishments.

I actually use Intuit for doing my taxes and I am seeing more and more that it is becoming the standard in financial technology to where the more I learn about them and their technology roles, the more I am interested in learning more.
I feel that my current role as a back-end developer at HealthStream would fit in nicely with the back-end and data-science roles at Intuit.

If you can could you tell more about these roles, especially the data-science roles?

Would you be interested in setting up a call with me?

Thanks,
Chris


Hey Michael,

 I love both Activision and Blizzard games. I am also a software engineer in the Los Angeles area! I have some experience with C++ and Unreal Engine, as well as extensive knowledge in Python, Java and C#. I am very interested in attending the Level Up U program and working for Activision as a Game Developer. Would you be avaliable to set up a call with me so that I can learn more? I am available Tuesday and Thursday after 3:00pm PST if that works for you!

Hope to hear from you soon,
Z. Marshall
