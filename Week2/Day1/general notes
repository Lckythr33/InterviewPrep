Sliding Windows

Recognition:
Working with a linear data set
are we trying to maximize or minimize a substring 
Can you think of a quadratic solution or is there overlapping or unnecessary work 

Tools:
Try quadratic approach first
    - what data structures or state variables are used

 Next try two pointer approach w/ left and right pointers beginning at index 0
    - How can we make use of the data structures from the quadratic approach 
     - hunting phase (expand)
     - catchup phase (contract)

Problem Min Window substring

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
A D O B E C O D E B  A  N  C       , abc | find smallest group of letters that contain ABC

BANC is our answer here.

for i
    for char in t:
        check if char in current substring
