# Tree Traversals: (tree is a type of graph)
#   -Depth first search (DFS)  //use recursion for DFS
#       -Traverse as far as you can along each branch
#		-Back out of that branch
#		-Pick other branches to explore, start at step 1 again
#
#   -Breadth first search (BFS)
#		-Explore each level before moving to the next level
#		-Explore all nodes on the current level
#		-Move on to the next level
