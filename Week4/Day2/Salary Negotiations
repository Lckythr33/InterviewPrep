Reframing negotiation
Navigate offer call

Tools to use in negotiation

Negotiations are normal when making a deal:

    A job offer IS a deal
    A normal part of the job search

Negotiations begin at the beginning 

Both want to come to an Agreement:

    Your Mindset:
        
        You must believe you deserve what you are asking
        Recognized you earned the offer from likely 100s of candidates

    Company Mindset:

        They are extending an offer because they feel *you are a great fit*

    Time the company spent assessing candidates

        Recruiter call
        coding challenge
        Tech screen

An offer means they want YOU 

They see your value

Reframe Fixed -> Open

Fixed Pie:
Seeing negotiation as greedy
Unsure if reasonable
Worried you might harm the relationship
If I negotiate I may lose the offer

Negotiation Possibilities:
Negotiating while solidifying a deal is normal
you stand by your asks
a job is a deal for both sides
focus on what you can gain
negotiating will not cause you to lose the offer

Exploding offer is a quick offer that expires within 24-48hrs

Exploding offers - getting more time:

    More time = increased likelyhood of more options and leverage 
    Push back on the timeline while you are on the phone

Decline Big Decision
    Really big decision, need more time to decide

Push back on the timeline
    I cant decide in that amount of time, give them the power to make an exception fro you
    dont ask them directly

Justifications:

    Providing ANY reason is helpful 
    Always justify your asks - even if the justification itself isnt important
    Odds increased by 33% - just by saying "because"

Entering the Back and Forth : Logistics

    -Reflect on and review your leverage 
    -Always justify your asks
    -Limit your back and forth to 2 cycles

Thank them have excitement for the role 

If they can make the adjustment youll turn down other offers and sign

Email vs Phone negotiations
    to have a paper trail
    easy to forward on their side
    able to think about it for longer

Gives you time to 
    -Digest al the details of the offer
    -Reflect on whats important to you
    -Compose yourself and provide a coherant argument for what you want
